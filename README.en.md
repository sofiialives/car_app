## Project Description

This repository is part of the GoIT technical task for developing a website with a car rental system on an hourly basis. The site offers functionality that allows users to search for and rent cars by the hour in a convenient way.

## Key Features:

- **Car Brand Filtering:** Users can select cars by their brand, providing a convenient and fast search.

- **Car Rental:** The system allows users to rent cars by the hour. The booking and confirmation mechanism makes the process simple and secure.

- **Contacting the Service:** The site provides the ability to contact service staff or support for issue resolution and additional information.

## Environment Requirements

- **React**
- **Axios**
- **react-router-dom**
- **react-loader-spinner**
- **axios**
- **react-redux**
- **redux-persistor**
- **styled-components**
- **web-vitals**

## Installation Instructions

In the project directory, run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000/car_app/](http://localhost:3000/car_app/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
